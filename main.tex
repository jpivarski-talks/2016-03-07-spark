\begin{frame}{Strategy}
\begin{block}{Scope}
Spark is just one big data technology, but almost all of them share a common difficulty: the data backbone is implemented in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

\vspace{0.2 cm}
This doesn't mean that users must use Java (I use a mix of Scala and Python), but it does mean that data must be efficiently converted into a JVM-friendly format to be used at a large scale.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Methods}
I've been keeping three options open:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pure Java using FreeHEP (reimplementation of ROOT in Java by Tony Johnson).
\item Direct ROOT C++ $\to$ JVM connection with JNI (or an abstraction layer on top of it, such as JNA).
\item ROOT C++ as an external process, passing serialized data through a pipe.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pure Java using FreeHEP: works, but I have concerns about its efficiency for non-local files (e.g. xrootd). When all three options are ready, this method should be featured in a performance study.

\item Direct ROOT C++ $\to$ JVM: this now works as well. The random segmentation faults I was experiencing were related to interference between ROOT's signal handlers and Java's signal handlers.

\item ROOT C++ as an external process: of course this should work, and I've been putting my efforts here so that we at least have a working baseline. I'm using Avro to stream data from the ROOT process to the JVM process. Avro is an efficient binary format with bindings in many languages.
\end{itemize}
